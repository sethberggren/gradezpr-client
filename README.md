<br></br>

This is the frontend for my web app, Gradezpr. Gradezpr was born of a desire to make the grading process as a teacher quicker. I found myself doing the same repetitive tasks over and over, like correcting student names to match the gradebook, curving grades, and looking at summary statistics for assignments. Gradezpr was designed to do all of these tasks and more.

<br></br>

Gradezpr's main feature is its ability to automatically match up student information in assignments scoresheets on Google Sheets or Excel files with the 'official' student information the end-user uploads. This is beneficial as sometimes the assignment scoresheets have pseudonyms for students (Ben vs. Benjamin, for example), which can cause errors for importing grades into Learning Managment Systems, like PowerSchool.

<br></br>

Gradezpr's frontend was built using a variety of technologies. Here's a list of notable tools leveraged:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript </a></li>
<li><a href="https://reactjs.org/">React </a></li>
<li><a href="https://chakra-ui.com/">ChakraUI </a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a></li>
</ul>
